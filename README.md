# YoomJS - MVC Framework for NodeJS

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xpepermint/yoomjs.svg?branch=master)
[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/yoom.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/yoom)
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/xpepermint/yoomjs.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/xpepermint/yoomjs)

YoomJS is a next generation web framework for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) built on top of [KoaJS](http://koajs.com/). YoomJS mimics the MVC pattern of frameworks like [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) which makes writing custom, enterprise-grade [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) applications fast and enjoyable.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Make sure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) version `0.11.13` or later is installed. You can easily installing a fresh version of [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) using the [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

You also need [Bower](http://www.bowserjs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) commands available from the command-line.

### Yoom

Install the package.

```
npm install -g yoom
```

After the installation the `yoom` command-line script will be available. Run `yoom --help` to see the list of available commands.

### Create New Project

Use the `yoom` command to create a new application directory structure.

```
yoom new {project-path}
```

From `{project-path}` start the application server.

```
yoom start
```

You can also run open the application in your default browser.

```
yoom open
```

The project is ready and you can start building your next generation web application, API, or website.
